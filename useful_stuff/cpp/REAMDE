This is a collection of some really useful C++ 
Libraries which I have created. They are designed 
to be simple to use and be generic enough for 
use in multiple situtations. 

Config_Parser - A config file parser similar to boost program options, but much simpler to deploy. 

Progress_Bar  - A simple command-line progress bar

String Functions - Some really simple string utilities.
