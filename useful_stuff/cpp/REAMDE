This is a collection of some really useful C++ 
Libraries which I have created. They are designed 
to be simple to use and be generic enough for 
use in multiple situtations. 

Config_Parser - A config file parser similar to boost program options, but much simpler to deploy. 

Logger - A logging utility which will help you control your output

Progress_Bar  - A simple command-line progress bar

String Functions - Some really simple string utilities. 

Unit Test - A simple unit test framework
