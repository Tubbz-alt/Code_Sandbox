This is a collection of junk that I find useful in my day-to-day activities.  Feel free
to borrow, steal, improve or gripe about anything here.  I probably got it from someone
else while creating it. 

I have my Project Euler solutions, example code snippits for different libraries, 
vim configuration files, alpine configuration files, and more.  If there is anything that I 
should add, just let me know.
