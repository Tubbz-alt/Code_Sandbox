This is a repo containing useful libraries and utilities I have created.

This is in an effort to annotate and document projects which are good enough to 
use and deploy in a general sense.

Feel free to use any code which you find in this repo.  I ask that you send me any
improvements or modifications so that I can potentially add them permanently.
