Useful Powershell Scripts
===============================


PuTTyTel.ps1 - This is a Powershell script which will take PuTTy and make it run like 
               ctel from ClusterSSH.

Disclaimer:  My ACL Script is designed to show how to use it.  Do not use it like that unless you really don't care about computer security!
