\begin{description}
\item[Orthorectification] A method of correcting an image to align with real-world coordinates on a map. 
                          This involves measuring the exact location of the image center as well as 
                          the camera angle.  This is followed by the computation of the camera calibration 
                          parameters to remove camera and lens distortions.  Finally, you may terrain
                          induced distortions using DEM data.

\item $H$ - Height of the camera above ground, \emph{Flying Height}
\item $B$ - Distance between two image, \emph{Air Base}
