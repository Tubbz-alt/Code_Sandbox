\opening{Dear Drone Deploy}

I am writing to you to express my interest in the Python Software Engineer position with DroneDeploy.  
I believe that I have the requisite knowledge and experience to provide valuable contributions to
your company.

Currently, I am a Software Engineer with the Sierra Nevada Corporation in Sparks, NV.  My primary focus 
is in Photogrammetry.  I write most of my daily code in C++, however I do extensive prototyping and testing
in Python.  Specifically, I spend considerable time using GDAL and OpenCV in both Python and C++.


\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
