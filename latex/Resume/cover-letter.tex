\opening{Dear Drone Deploy}

I am writing to you to express my interest in the Python Software Engineer position with your company.  
I believe that I have the requisite knowledge and experience to provide valuable contributions to
your company.

Currently, I am a Software Engineer with the Sierra Nevada Corporation in Sparks, NV.  My primary focus 
is in Photogrammetry and Computer Vision for the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division.  
I write most of my daily code in C++, however I do extensive prototyping and testing
in Python.  Specifically, I spend considerable time using GDAL and OpenCV in both Python and C++.
In addition, I spend considerable time integrating that in


\closing{Sincerely,}

%Currently, I am a software engineer with the Sierra Nevada Corporation. I specialize in Image Processing and Computer Vision for the Intelligence, Surveillance, and %Reconnaissance Division. My primary project is developing a distributed, multi-processor image processing platform for use in US Air Force Unmanned Aerial Systems. %Specifically, I am responsible for the development of the image ortho-rectification pipeline, an MPI communication framework, GIS-related libraries such as coordinate %transforms and vector/shapefile processing, and the underlying Linux/Unix-like framework for managing our software. Our software development team is very small, so I have had %the unique opportunity to have a large range of tasks. Some libraries which I have considerable experience with are GDAL, OpenCV, NGA GeoTrans, NASA Vision Workbench, and %MPI. 

%In addition to my current job, I have also worked as an intern at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA. For two summers, I worked on satellite imagery of the %Lunar and Martian surface. This required developing C++ software for the NASA Vision Workbench which was run on the Pleiades Supercomputer. With this internship, I was able %to publish academic research as an undergraduate student and develop valuable C++ skills. Recently, I also completed a 7 year enlistment with the Nevada Air National Guard. %During my enlistment, I was an avionics technician where I repaired and maintained C-130 Navigation, Communication, and Electronic Counter-Measure equipment. I have %familiarity with maps, navigational instruments, and avionics.
%
%In addition to my work experience, I am also contributing code to the OpenCV project. Specifically, I am trying to add support for GDAL to the OpenCV image IO library.
%
%In conclusion, I believe that I have a wide array of skills to offer as well as the ability to pick up new ones. I am very passionate about GIS software and I hope to have %the opportunity to contribute to the Apple Maps platform.
